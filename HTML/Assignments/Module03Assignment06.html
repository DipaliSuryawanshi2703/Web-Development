    <h3>About Brown Bear</h3>
   <a href="/About Brown Bear.html"  >About </a>
   <p>brown bear, (Ursus arctos), shaggy-haired bear (family Ursidae) native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern North
        America. Numerous forms of the brown bear have been described; they are treated as several subspecies of Ursus
        arctos. One subspecies, the Kodiak bear (U. arctos middendorffi), weighs up to 720 kg (1,600 pounds) and is
        often considered to be the world’s largest carnivore, a title it shares with the polar bear (U. maritimus),
        which grows to a similar size. Although North American brown bears are traditionally called grizzlies, this
        common name refers formally to the subspecies U. arctos horribilis, which is widespread across northwestern
        North America (see grizzly bear)</p>
